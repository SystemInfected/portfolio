One of the biggest websites I've ever made and I'm really proud that it's finally launched. Nodell is a Swedish platform created to promote freedom of speech, social criticism and political debates. The site is a hybrid of citizen- and social-journalism which means that anyone can write and publish content.

Everything on the website is tailor-made by yours truly, some of the features are:

- WYSIWYG article editor.
- User system where your account level up as you become more popular.
- Admin control panel and comment moderation.
- Algorithm for showing relevant content with fair popularity considerations.
  Whats truly most popular is what will be listed as such... _cough_ youtube _cough_.
