A complete rebuild of their previous website. I redesigned and rebuilt it from scratch with an up-to-date design and smart features to make updating the website easier and keep the website alive.
I also created a new graphic profile for web and print including a new fresh logo and color scheme.
All graphics and icons are custom made.

Some of the features are:

- Custom CMS for easy management.
- Quotation system for fast customer response.
- Custom business area specific icons and illustrations.
